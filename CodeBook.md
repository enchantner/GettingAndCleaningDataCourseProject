## Description

This codebook includes some information on variables, data and transformations
performed. This work is a part of a course project on Getting and Cleaning Data
course at coursera.org from Johns Hopkins University.

## Sources

Description of the raw data used in this project can be found here: [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[Raw data provided in Coursera course is here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

## Workflow

Script assumes that data is downloaded from the link above and is located at "UCI HAR Dataset"
folder at the working directory. Working directory is specified inside script itself
and should be changed by hand before its execution.

Libraries "data.table" and "plyr" are used to simplify and speed up the code.

Code an be splittet to several "stages":

- merging training and test data for labels and input sets
- loading features
- setting proper column names according to features
- loading labels for activities
- setting proper column names according to activities
- merging training and test data for subjects
- merging all data into a single dataframe for analysis
- calculating averages of each variable for each activity and each subject

## Resulting data

Resulting dataset have following columns (variables):

- "Subject"
- "Activity"
- "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"
- "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"
- "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"
